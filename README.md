# Butler Info Plugin
This plugin helps keep track of information relating to a POH butler/servant. It tracks things like the items the butler is holding, time until butler returns from bank, and number of trips until payment is required again.
## Future plans
* Tracking gold spent on servant per session
* Tracking items fetched per session
